## Running the Landing Page Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aUnicornDev/tabsMonster.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd tabsMonster/docs
```


For now there are no dependencies, so open up VS code and use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension to run the Website.
